# ArrayTs
**ArrayTs** is a [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) library which *enhances* the *javascript* [`array`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) *type* by exposing additional extension methods, similar to the [`IEnumerable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=netframework-4.8) *interface* in [Microsoft's](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) *framework*. The *generic* [`Array&lt;T>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) *interface* is being *extended* for the [ArrayTs (2020)](https://github.com/RyanMauldin/ArrayTs) implementation of the [`IEnumerable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=netframework-4.8) *interface* features, *exposed* to the *javascript* [`array`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) *type*. The [ArrayJs (2013)](https://github.com/EmptyCubes/Array.js) version differed in implementation semantics, in that the [`IEnumerable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=netframework-4.8) *interface extension methods* exposed to the *javascript* [`array`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) *type*, were previously *coupled*, *directly* to the *javascript* [`array`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) *type*, extended through *prototype extension method definitions*, e.g., `Array.prototype.zip = function (second, zipFn) {...}`.

When *prototype extension method definitions* are used in **isolation** of other *conflicting* libraries, the *extended prototype coding conventions* are **practical**. *Prototype extension method* *definitions* align themselves to be **directly** *called* off of the *root type* that is already being dealt with from a library standpoint, e.g. *javascript* [`array`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) *type*. Having *direct access* to the *extension methods* off of the *root type* further *minimizes* the amount of code needed to be *implemented* by the *developer*, and the *developer* is less likely to need to explicitly cast all generically typed facets to be explicitly defined. The [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler with *generics* or *complicated interfaces*, and the overall *code aesthetics* and *readability* when dealing with the *extended type* will be at its most *condensed* and *concise* state. Utilizing *prototype extension method conventions* however, was **not** a *favorable approach* when contemplating the *redesign* of **ArrayTs**. The *stance* **ArrayTs** is taking **now**, is that *this library* **must** be *reliable* and *resilient* to *failure* throughout an application's *entire development life-cycle*. **ArrayTs** **must** remain *resilient to failure* when *adding* or *swapping out*, additional *external* *javascript* or [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) *repository packages* from *popular sources*, e.g. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). **ArrayTs** should also remain *side-effect free* while developers are implementing *solution configuration changes*, as well as when *upgrading* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) versions. **ArrayTs** *now has* the *capability* to *adopt* a *favorable audience*.

For this new *desired level* of *stability* in this **ArrayTs** library to be possible, this redesign had *avoided* using any *prototype extension method definitions* throughout. *Pitfalls* for *extending prototype method definitions* on a *common type*, such as the *built-in* *javascript* [`array`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) *type*, placed **ArrayTs** at *great risk* for *external package repository integration* [failures](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8859828/javascript-what-dangers-are-in-extending-array-prototype), e.g. when consuming other *well-known repository library packages* from *popular package repository sources*, e.g. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). *External repository packages* have the *capability* to *introduce* *extension method name collisions* for libraries which **compete** to *extend* the *javascript* [`array`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) *type*, with their own *prototype extension* method definitions. This is especially true for **ArrayTs**, when considering the following used method names, e.g. `Clone()`, `Count()`, `Contains()`. These used method names are commonly used names in the industry in general, even beyond any specific usage withing the intended [`IEnumerable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=netframework-4.8) *interface* *space*, especially *non-IEnumerable* implemented methods such as `Clone()`. `Clone()`, for instance, is *custom* to this **ArrayTs** list of *extension methods*, and is **not listed** as an [`IEnumerable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=netframework-4.8) *interface* method. However, `Clone()` could *very easily* be *encountered* within other *common repository packages*.

**Major Refactor Notes**
**02/27/2020** - [Ryan Mauldin](https://github.com/ryanmauldin), refactored the original ArrayJS library to use a completely [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) & non-prototype based approach.

```typescript
// Usage:
/// <reference path="./ArrayTs/ArrayTs.ts"
const numbers: Array<number> = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
const words: Array<string> = [ "one", "two", "three" ];
let zipped = new Array<string>();
if (!ArrayTs.IsNullOrEmpty(numbers) && !ArrayTs.IsNullOrEmpty(words))
    zipped = (<ArrayTs.Get<string>>words).Zip(numbers, (first: string, second: number) => first + " " + second);
for (const zip of zipped) { console.log(zip); }
```
