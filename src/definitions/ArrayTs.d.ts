 * Created by Jack on 6/29/2014.
 * Updated by Ryan Mauldin on 3/14/2020.
 *  * interface Array<T> became a repetitively outdated definition.
 *  * will be adding this back, renaming the file, and moving its location to
 *  * the project root as index.d.ts, once the UMD modular based design approach
 *  * has begun. May end up renaming this whole library to a module named IArray,
 *  * instead of ArrayTs, as new ArrayTs() vs new IArray(), yeah IArray() is
 *  * much cooler, so I have much thinking to do.
